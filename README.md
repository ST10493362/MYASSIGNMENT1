# MYASSIGNMENT1

This is an application that I have designed to help users pick from various meal suggestions depening on the time of the day that they input.
I would like to think that it is user friendly because all you have to do is type "morning", "mid-morning", "afternoon", "mid-afternoon", "dinner", or "after dinner" and the various options will come up. The application has a clear button in case the user has inserted the wrong time of day.
